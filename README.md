# ✈️ Airline Review Analysis & Ticket Purchase Prediction

This project was done as part of a Data Science job simulation with **British Airways** on the Forage platform.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal was to:
- Collect real-world airline reviews and ratings through web scraping
- Analyze trends and patterns in customer feedback
- Build a predictive model to determine if a customer would buy a ticket based on certain features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and prototyping

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - Scraped reviews from an airline rating website
   - Extracted reviewer name, rating, review text, and additional metadata

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values
   - Engineered features such as sentiment polarity, review length, etc.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualized rating distributions and trends
   - Identified patterns in customer satisfaction

4. **Model Building:**
   - Used classification algorithms to predict ticket purchase behavior
   - Compared models based on accuracy and interpretability

## ✅ Outcome

Successfully created a machine learning pipeline that can:
- Analyze new review data
- Predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a ticket


## 🙌 Acknowledgments

- **British Airways** & **The Forage** for the simulation
- Open-source libraries that made this possible
